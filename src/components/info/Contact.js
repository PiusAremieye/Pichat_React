          I am well versed in Backend technologies like Java, Ruby. I am also
          familiar with some Frontend frameworks and technologies like React.Js,
          Html, Css, Bootstrap. I have built many Apis using Java that no Api
          will be too hard for me to build. I strongly believe that all websites
          should be responsive and accessible to all.
